FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Local Teens Learn Computer Programming Using Raspberry Pi Microcomputers

Durham, NC – [Refresh the Triangle](https://www.meetup.com/refreshthetriangle/) is proud to announce [Teen Tech Camp 2013](https://durhamcountylibrary.org/2013/06/teen-tech-camp-2013/), a one-day event to teach computer programming to area youth. The camp is the second to be hosted by Refresh the Triangle, in partnership with [Durham County Library](https://durhamcountylibrary.org/).

This year, students will learn basic [Python](https://python.org/) computer programming concepts through the use of interactive curriculum with a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), a pocket sized PC developed in the UK by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_Foundation) with the intention of promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools.

Along with generous community volunteer support, a grant from the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) has made it so that each of the 20 students will receive his or her own Raspberry Pi, books and other materials to help further computer programing education.

Support from the following organizations has also helped to make this event possible: [Ayima](https://www.ayima.com/), [Adzerk](https://www.adzerk.com/), [Caktus Group](https://caktusgroup.com/), [Greenlight Community Broadband](https://www.greenlightnc.com/), [Linux New Media](https://www.linuxnewmedia.com/), [Splatspace](https://splatspace.org/), [Triangle Ecycling](https://www.triangleecycling.com/), [TriLUG](https://www.trilug.org/), [TriPython](https://trizpug.org/) and [Verified Studios](https://verifiedstudios.com/).

The event will take place Tuesday, August 13, at the Southwest Durham Regional Library (3605 Shannon Rd., Durham, NC 27707) from 10:00AM – 5:00PM.
